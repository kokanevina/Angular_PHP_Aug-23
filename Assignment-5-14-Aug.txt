Create Trainer class with instance variables
Create Student Class with instance variables

in Trainer class there should be addStudent method which will accept Student object as parameter and
should add that object in Student type array (means for 1 trainer we are assigning many students)

in Trainer class there should be getStudents method which will return Student array (means for that trainer which students are assigned that to be displayed)

Test whether both methods are working or not
